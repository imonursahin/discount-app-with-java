## Project Detail
On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
1.	If the user has gold card of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2.	If the user has silver card of the store, he gets a 20% discount
3. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
4. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
5. For every $200 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 950, you get $ 20 as a discount).
6. The percentage based discounts do not apply on phones.
